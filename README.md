This an implementation of Chess in Java using Swing for the UI

The goal of the project was to serve as an introductory to Java since this was my first experience with it.

The Main File is ChessGame.java and contains the main function to run the application. This implentation includes a fully playable version of Chess including promotion, castling, and en passant.

The side bar currently keeps a record of the last 10 moves taken and informs users on turns, checks, and checkmates.

There are still some additions/enhancements that could be made to the project but for the time being, it will remain as is.
